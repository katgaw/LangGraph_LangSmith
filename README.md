LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.

Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional "DAG" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!

### Steps to Run:

1. Create a Python 3.11 environment
2. `pip install jupyter` so you can run the notebook
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements
